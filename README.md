# WordTrace
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
Word trace is an activity developed as a part of research experiment on the poem vowels written by Arthur Rimbaud(1854-1891).

Idea of the project: 
	Every person has different experiences in life and interprets the poem in their own way. 
	Lets consider the word "RED", Red is te word the resembles love and passion. But at the same time it may be a symbol of sacrifice of a soldier in the war.
		
	The main idea about the project is to understand the interpretations of every individual and the way they can connect to the poem.
